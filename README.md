# Personal Behaviors Factors to Predict Heart Disease

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is one of the major
causes of death in the United States for people of all races (African Americans, American Indians and
Alaska Natives, and Whites). High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are three major risk
factors for heart disease that affect over half of all Americans (47 percent).



Diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption are all
important markers. In healthcare, detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact
on heart disease is critical. As a result, weâ€™d like to employ Machine Learning to assist doctors and
researchers in better understanding and predicting cardiac disease before it becomes a serious problem
for patients.
